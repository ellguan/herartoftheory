        <p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, while women make up <span class="p1">46.8%</span> of the
          workforce,
          women only make up <span class="p2">28%</span> of STEM jobs.</p>
        <p>Likewise, only <span class="p2">21%</span> of engineers are women, and only <span class="p2">19%</span> of
          computer scientists are women.</p>

        <h1>Why does this happen?</h1>
        <h2>Let's break it down.</h2>
        <p>1. There is a major <b>underrepresentation</b> of STEM women in the workforce, which means there are <b>less
            models</b> for younger women to look up to. This discourages young women from working in such fields, which
          in
          turn, reinforces the fewer women STEM majors. This becomes <b>an endless cycle</b>.</p>
        <p>2. STEM majors, especially those relating to math and physics, are seen as more <b>masculine</b>. This
          harmful
          bias prevents younger women from pursuing such fields.</p>
        <p>3. Women already in these fields are often <b>mistreated</b>. There have been many cases where professionals
          and
          teachers look down and overlook the potential of young women. Similarly, there have been many instances where
          the work of women scientists has been overshadowed or overlooked. Learn more about these stories <a

        <p>If you are a student, talk to a teacher or school official about creating STEM opportunities around your school.
          You
          can also lead a club that advocates for more support and equality among all genders in STEM studies.</p>
        <p>If you are a parent, join a parents' association at your student's school and speak out about encouraging
          everyone, not just one group, to learn about STEM subjects.</p>

        <p>This Iranian mathematician grew up in an all girls' school with a principal who didn't anticipate any woman
          competing for Iran's International Mathematical Olympiad Team, but in both her junior and senior year of high
          school, Maryam won a gold medal in the competition. She later became the only woman ever to win the Fields
          medal
          for her work in hyperbolic surfaces and topology. This medal is comparable to the Nobel Prize for mathematics.
          In her honor, the University of Oxford created the Mirzhakani Society for women and non-binary students
          studying
          mathematics. </p>

        <p>Nicknamed "The First Lady of Physics", this Chinese-American nuclear physicist joined the Manhattan Project,
          a
          top-secret project to build the first nuclear bomb in Colombia University in 1944. After the war, her work
          turned towards beta decay, when she conducted an experiment proving that the law of parity does not hold up
          during beta decay. This experiment is now known as the Wu Experiment, however, instead of Wu winning the Nobel
          Prize for her work, two male fellow physicists who approached her into conducting this experiment won the
          famed
          award instead. Later in her life, she continued her research that later shifted to sickle-cell anemia and
          was
          a strong advocate for young girls in STEM to pursue their interests. </p>

        <p>This American biologist first found a deep interest in science at a very young age, when she studied that
          major at Cornell University in 1919. At first, her mother would not let her go, because her mother's first
          priority was for her to get married. However, she did anyway, and this eventually led to her studying the
          chromosomal makeup of corn. Genetics, her field of study, was way ahead of her time and was ignored for many
          years, until the 70's, when the scientific community finally recognized her. She was the first woman to be the
          sole winner of the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.</p>
